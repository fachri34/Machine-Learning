# Range Salary in Role Data

## Project Overview

This project involves the implementation of a regression model using various machine learning algorithms to predict a target variable. 

## Overall Steps:
1. Import all Libraries & Load the Dataset
   Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
   Load the dataset for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   Analyze categorical and numerical data for insights into the dataset.
   
3. Split Data (Train and Test)
   Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
   
5. Removing Redundant Variables
   Identify and remove redundant variables based on business value.

6. Data Preparation: Data Train
    Drop duplicated data

7. Data Preparation: Data Test
  Drop duplicated data.

8. Encoding Preparation
        Prepare the data for encoding.
   
10. Encode Separately for Data Train and Data Test
        Perform encoding on categorical variables for both training and testing sets.
  
11. Standard Scaler
    Standardize the features using Standard Scaler.
    
12. Split Data into Xtrain, ytrain, Xtest, ytest
   Separate features (X) and target variable (y) for both training and testing sets.

13.  Modelling Classification ML Algorithms:
    Decision Tree
    K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
    Ridge
    Lasso
   
14. Evaluation Model:
    RMSE & R2
